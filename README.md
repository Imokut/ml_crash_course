Notebooks from Google's Machine Learning Course

## 4 [Representation with a Feature Cross and bucketing](Representation_with_a_Feature_Cross_and_bucketing.ipynb)
Working with numerical data that isn't modelled as a floating point value. Rather than create categorical values, we create buckets or a feature cross.

## 5 [Binary Classification](5_Binary_Classification.ipynb)
This notebook covers building a classification model using sigmoid activation and binary cross entropy as loss function. Precision, recall, accuracy and AUC are metrics used in this notebook. 

## 6 [Intro to Neural Networks](6_Intro_to_Neural_Nets.ipynb)
A brief intro to neural networks. The spiral regression problem

## 7 [Multiclass CLassification](7_Multi_class_classification_with_MNIST.ipynb)
This notebook covers building a deep learning model to identify 10 classes of digit images from the MNIST dataset. This classification is possible using the softmax activation function.

## 8 [Intro to Fairness](8_intro_to_fairness.ipynb)
This notebook covers how to spot bias in ml and correct them. 
other noteable functions
- plot confusion matrix
- plot data with facet dive
